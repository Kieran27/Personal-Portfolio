## About
This is my personal portfolio site. Designed to display the work I have created in a clear and concise way. It was built with HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript. No frameworks or external libraries were used.

### Intention

I wanted my portfolio site to be simple, clear and avoid unnecessary animations/ transitions that would detract from the visibility and overall clarity of the information presented on the site. I decided to make a basic site using only HTML, CSS and Javascript as I felt this best matched the intention and scope of the project and would be simple to change/configure etc. I also wanted the design to be fully responsive on a wide range of devices. The font of "IBM Plex Mono" was a key element in the site's design. I had seen it implemented on a few sites and was something I had always wanted to use for the right project. The neutral typeface aimed to tie the design together and a create a 'technical' feeling to the work on the site.

### Design
Design was always conceived to be simple, clear and concise, with strong contrast and a colour palette consisting of two contrasting colours; in this case being black and white. Content was to have an adequate height such that the content had plenty of whitespace to 'breathe' and not feel constricted or tight.

### What I Learned
Delving into CSS is always fun. Whilst the styling relies heavily on flexbox I did gain some interesting knowledge on the scroll-padding property to avoid my fixed navbar from overlapping the content when links were clicked. Furthermore, learning more about different media queries such as the hover query was also beneficial in removing the hover section on each project for devices that do not support hover events.

Purchasing and configuring my own domain was also an interesting challenge and learning experience. It definitely adds an extra layer of professionalism to the site and is something I'm glad I now know how to implement.
